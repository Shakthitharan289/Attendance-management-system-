The program is a Java-based GUI Attendance Management System that uses Swing components for user interaction. 
It allows users to add student names, mark their attendance, and view the attendance list.
The current implementation uses fixed-size arrays to store student data, which limits scalability and does not handle duplicates or invalid inputs gracefully.
Enhancements like replacing arrays with dynamic structures (e.g., ArrayList), adding error handling for duplicate or non-existent entries, and providing feedback messages can significantly improve the system.
Additionally, features like persistent storage, a dropdown for selecting students, and a more polished UI can make the application more robust and user-friendly.
